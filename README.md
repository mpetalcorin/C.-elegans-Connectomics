# C.-elegans-Connectomics
C. elegans connectomics is the study of the worm’s nervous system by mapping every neuron and the synapses connecting them, turning microscope images into a complete wiring diagram, then using that map to explain how specific circuits generate behaviour, pipeline for C. elegans volume EM cutouts, from image stacks to a draft connectivity graph
